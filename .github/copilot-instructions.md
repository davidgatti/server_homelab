This repository is a Docker Compose that codifies my HomeLab setup in one repository with the goal to allow me to spin up all the services that i need by just cloning this repo on a new machine and be up and running with little work. Which I don't have much off in the weekedns or after houers. So this repository has to be as autoamted as posible, and as easy to understant. Becasue after work i don't have mcuh brain power left to deal with potential problems.

## Work Styles

PRIORITY â€“ READ THIS FILE, UNDERSTAND THIS FILE, FOLLOW THIS FILE, MAKE THIS FILE YOUR BIBLE, AND ACCEPT THAT YOU ARE BOUND BY THE RULES OF THIS REPO AND MOST OF ALL FOLLW THE OWNER INSTRUCTIONS, AS HE ASK, AND IF NOT SURE, ASK FOR CLARIFICATION.

## Coding sytle

Wrtie small fucntions that do one job well, and then chain them to do the whole execution, this way it is easy to understant what is going on, and if needed working on one fuction will make it clear waht was the problem and how it wasfixed.
