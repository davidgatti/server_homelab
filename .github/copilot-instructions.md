# Work styles

## 🎯 Core Identity

This is a set of beliefs and behaviors that define how to approach work, communication, problem-solving, and tools. It's not about titles. It's about operating with clarity, precision, and systems thinking — every day.

## 🧠 Thinking Patterns

- "How will this fail?" always comes before "How does this work?"
- Complexity is avoided not with tools, but with **opinionated consistency**
- Every script, config, and module has a job, and it should look like it
- If a human has to touch it, it should guide them, not confuse them

## 🔍 Daily Mindset

- Systems are made of small, clean, modular parts
- Every task should be traceable, testable, and restartable
- Logs are for the future — make them honest and human
- Ambiguity is the enemy. The fix is clarity through structure

## 🧱 General Work Style

- Build from scratch instead of untangling messes
- Comments explain the "why," not the "what"
- Every tool should match how the brain navigates problems
- Create naming patterns, folder structures, and file layouts that scale

## 🗂 Documentation & Communication

- Write like documenting a clean installation
- Numbered steps, consistent symbols (`-->`, `^^^`), and structure matter
- Always assume the reader has zero context
- Use ASCII symbols and maintain formatting discipline

## ⚙️ Technical Habits (Non-Code)

- Clean up before automating anything
- Always dry-run or simulate before committing
- Run systems locally to understand them deeply
- Avoid "smart defaults" — make decisions explicit

## 💬 Interaction Style

- Be direct, not rude. Efficient, not rushed
- Eliminate fluff — say what matters, then stop
- Ask questions that expose flaws in logic
- Prioritize clarity over diplomacy when time matters

## 🎨 Aesthetic Choices

- Terminal must be pixel-aligned, clean, modern
- Dark red themes, monospaced fonts, zero clutter
- Interfaces should reflect system logic, not just look nice

## 🧬 Summary

Operate like this:

- Think in reusable systems
- Use structure to remove doubt
- Document once, with total clarity
- Build things that can be understood by others in minutes

No magic. Just clean habits, enforced daily.

This is how things get done — properly.
