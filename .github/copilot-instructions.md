This repository is a Docker Compose that codifies my HomeLab setup in one repository with the goal to allow me to spin up all the services that i need by just cloning this repo on a new machine and be up and running with little work. Which I don't have much off in the weekedns or after houers. So this repository has to be as autoamted as posible, and as easy to understant. Becasue after work i don't have mcuh brain power left to deal with potential problems.
