# Dynamic Network Detection with Environment Variables

**Date**: 2025-08-24 13:32  
**Type**: Major Infrastructure Enhancement  
**Impact**: High - Enables seamless network switching with elegant environment variable solution  
**Status**: ✅ Completed Successfully  

## Executive Summary

Implemented dynamic network detection using Docker Compose environment variables to automatically switch between research network (192.168.5.x) and lab network (192.168.3.x) while maintaining consistent last octets for DNS compatibility. This eliminates manual configuration changes when moving between environments with a much simpler approach than template files.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Variable-Based Configuration
- **File**: `compose.yaml`
- **Change**: Added environment variable substitution for all IP addresses and network settings
- **Pattern**: `${NETWORK_PREFIX:-192.168.5}.53` with fallback to research network
- **Rationale**: Simpler and more maintainable than template file generation
- **Impact**: Single compose file supports both network environments dynamically

### 2. Enhanced HomeLab Script with Environment Export
- **File**: `homelab.sh`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added automatic network detection logic
  - Simplified to export environment variables instead of template generation
  - Enhanced status reporting with network information
  - Added new `network` command for diagnostics
- **Rationale**: Environment variables are native Docker Compose feature, no template complexity
- **Impact**: Zero-configuration network switching with cleaner implementation

### 3. Environment Variable Configuration
- **NETWORK_PREFIX**: Set to detected network (192.168.5 or 192.168.3)
- **NETWORK_INTERFACE**: Set to detected interface (eno1, eth0, etc.)
- **Fallback Values**: Research network (192.168.5) and eno1 interface as defaults
- **Service IP Pattern**: `${NETWORK_PREFIX}.53-64` for consistent last octets

## System Status After Changes

### Network Detection Capabilities
- **Auto-Detection**: Analyzes current IP configuration to determine network
- **Interface Detection**: Automatically identifies correct network interface
- **Environment Export**: Sets NETWORK_PREFIX and NETWORK_INTERFACE variables
- **Docker Compose Integration**: Native variable substitution, no external tools needed

### Service Configuration
- **Dynamic IPs**: All services use `${NETWORK_PREFIX}.XX` format
- **DNS Compatible**: Consistent last octets maintain DNS resolution
- **Resource Limits**: All previous optimizations preserved
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive healthchecks maintained

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ Network detection logic tested on research network (192.168.5.x)
2. ✅ Environment variable substitution verified with docker compose config
3. ✅ All services started successfully with auto-detected configuration
4. ✅ Service health checks passing (all containers healthy)
5. ✅ Lab network configuration tested (192.168.3.x) via docker compose config
6. ✅ Template references cleaned up - removed outdated envsubst checks and template verification code

## Next Steps for Future AI Agents

1. **Network Switching**: Use `./homelab.sh network` to verify current network detection
2. **Service Management**: Start/restart automatically detects and configures for current network
3. **Manual Override**: Set NETWORK_PREFIX and NETWORK_INTERFACE manually if needed
4. **Testing**: Verify operation when moving between research and lab networks
5. **Troubleshooting**: Use `docker compose config` to see resolved configuration

## Rollback Information

- **Compose Backup**: Original `compose.yaml` backed up as `compose.yaml.backup`
- **Script Restoration**: Previous homelab.sh available in git history
- **Manual Configuration**: Can set environment variables manually if auto-detection fails
- **Recovery Steps**: 
  1. `cp compose.yaml.backup compose.yaml` (if needed)
  2. `export NETWORK_PREFIX=192.168.5 NETWORK_INTERFACE=eno1`
  3. `docker compose up -d`

## Implementation Details

### Environment Variable Pattern
```yaml
# Service IP addresses
ipv4_address: ${NETWORK_PREFIX:-192.168.5}.53

# Network configuration  
subnet: ${NETWORK_PREFIX:-192.168.5}.0/24
gateway: ${NETWORK_PREFIX:-192.168.5}.1
parent: ${NETWORK_INTERFACE:-eno1}
```

### Detection Logic
1. **Primary**: Check current IP addresses for 192.168.5.x or 192.168.3.x
2. **Secondary**: Analyze routing table for network presence
3. **Fallback**: Use default route interface with research network assumption
4. **Export**: Set environment variables for docker compose

### Benefits Over Template Approach
- **Simpler**: No template file generation or management
- **Native**: Uses Docker Compose's built-in environment variable support
- **Cleaner**: Single compose.yaml file with dynamic behavior
- **Maintainable**: Standard Docker Compose patterns, easier to understand
- **Reliable**: No file I/O operations during service start

## Additional Benefits

- **Portability**: Single codebase works in both environments
- **Maintenance**: Eliminates template file complexity
- **Reliability**: Native Docker Compose feature, well-tested
- **Consistency**: DNS-compatible IP addressing maintained
- **Debugging**: Easy to test with manual environment variable setting
